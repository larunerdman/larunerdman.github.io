                            <h3>Kensington Market</h3>
                            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/stores2.jpg" alt="" /></span>Kensington Market is one of Toronto's oldest, well-known, and visited neighbourhoods. During the early 20th cenutry, the was home to a large Jewish community. After World War II, much of the Jewish community moved further north in the city and new waves of immigrants moved into the neighbourhood, bringing with them their ethnic cuisine and products. Today, a visit to the market is a sensory trip around the world! The neighbourhood is a treasure trove of specialty food shops, vintage clothes stores, galleries, and cafes. On the last Sunday of the month from May to October, its streets are closed to motorists and pedestrians, buskers, and vendors take over the streets.</p>
                            <h3>Chinatown</h3>
                            <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/chinatown.jpg" alt="" /></span>Toronto's Chinatown is one of North America's largest Chinese neighbourhoods. The area is home to ethnic Chinese from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and elsewhere. This bustling neighbourhood is well known for its cuisine, dim sum restaurants, and exotic supermarkets, which are frequented by Torontonians of all ethnic backgrounds.</p>
